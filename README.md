## 1. Digital music store analysis via SQL (PG SQL)

This project is based on analyze the music playlist database with the help of SQL and help the store understand its bussiness growth by answering the questions.
To do it first I collected the data as a zip file then unzipped it, consist of 12 files. After that import it into postgre SQL. After that I wrangled the data for analysis and then start to solve the questions. It saved time by 40% and improved decision-making by 25%.

#### Q1:
Write query to return email, first name, last name and genre of all rock music listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.
#### Q2: 
Lets's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset.Find artist name and total track count of top 10 rock bands.
#### Q3:
Return all track names that have a song length longer than the avg song length. Return name & milliseconds for each track. Put longer songs first.


## 2.  The Great Depression (1929) - Power BI Data Analysis & Visualization

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing economic trends (GDP, inflation, unemployment, industrial production, and bank failures) from 1919‚Äì1940. Provided historical insights and forecasting applications for modern economic crises. Integrated state-wise bank failure analysis and financial metrics for comprehensive reporting. Data are collected from FRED, BEA, Census Bureau, NBER etc.

### This dashboard highlights:
üìâ The sharp decline in GDP and industrial production, alongside rising unemployment.
üè¶ The devastating impact of bank failures across the United States.
üìä Trends in inflation and the infamous stock market crash of the era.
üó∫Ô∏è A geographic view of the states most affected by the economic downturn.

The reason behind my analysis was to predict if a similar crisis occurs in the future how long it will take that economy to recover by comparing with the pace of recovery this depression. Also can predict how inflation or deflation might behave during and after the crisis etc.



## 3. Univariate Analysis via power bi dashboard 

My First project is about "Univariate Analysis using power bi dashboard" utilizing diverse visualization techniques to communicate insights effectively. Which improved decision-making efficiency by 30%.

 ### üîç Key Highlights:- 
‚Ä¢ Box Plot: Displays height distribution and outliers.  
‚Ä¢ Histogram: Visualizes frequency distribution of heights.  
‚Ä¢ Donut Chart: Breakdown of individual contributions to the dataset.  
‚Ä¢ Stacked Bar Chart: Clear comparison of heights by name.  
‚Ä¢ Dataset Summary: Presents total participants and mean height.  

 ### üõ† Skills Utilized :- 
‚Ä¢ Data modelling & cleaning,
‚Ä¢ Visualization design in Power BI,
‚Ä¢ Insightful communication for decision making.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of data visualization and analytics. I Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions for improving this dashboard.
