## 1. Univariate Analysis via power bi dashboard

My First project is about "Univariate Analysis using power bi dashboard" utilizing diverse visualization techniques to communicate insights effectively. Which improved decision-making efficiency by 30%.

 ### üîç Key Highlights:- 
‚Ä¢ Box Plot: Displays height distribution and outliers.  
‚Ä¢ Histogram: Visualizes frequency distribution of heights.  
‚Ä¢ Donut Chart: Breakdown of individual contributions to the dataset.  
‚Ä¢ Stacked Bar Chart: Clear comparison of heights by name.  
‚Ä¢ Dataset Summary: Presents total participants and mean height.  

 ### üõ† Skills Utilized :- 
‚Ä¢ Data modelling & cleaning.
‚Ä¢ Visualization design in Power BI.
‚Ä¢ Insightful communication for decision making.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of data visualization and analytics. I Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions for improving this dashboard.

## 2. Digital music store analysis via SQL (PG SQL)

This project is based on analyze the music playlist database with the help os SQL and help the store understand its bussiness growth by answering the questions.
To do it first I collected the data as a zip file then unzipped it, consist of 12 files. After that import it into postgre SQL. After that I wrangled the data for analysis and then start to solve the questions. It saved time by 40% and improved decision-making by 25%.

###Q1: Write query to return email, first name, last name and genre of all rock music listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.
###Q2: Lets's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset.Find artist name and total track count of top 10 rock bands.
